                        A Sprinkler System that Saves Water<br /><br />
                        A healthy, beautiful garden needs just the right amount of water to thrive. Hydrawise automatically adjusts watering based on highly accurate, internet-sourced local weather data. The system looks at the forecast and past history to ensure that just the right amount of irrigation is applied. This is accomplished via advanced Predictive Watering™, which fine-tunes watering based on the weather data. This leads to significant water savings from your sprinkler system, saving you both time and money.<br /><br />
                        Hydrawise uses only the most accurate weather stations available. With this flexible web-based weather system, you can even add your own weather stations or use free professionally maintained weather stations.<br /><br />
                        Sit back and relax. With Hydrawise, everything you need is in the palm of your hand. Remote access allows you to view, manage, and monitor your irrigation controller from your phone, tablet, or computer at your convenience.<br /><br />
                        Take the mystery out of your sprinkler timer. With Hydrawise reporting, you can see how much water you’ve used and how much water you’ve saved.<br /><br />
                        Monitor your water use and the state of your piping system with the optional flow meter. Receive automatic alerts when a pipe is broken or leak has occurred before it becomes a problem.<br /><br />
                        Combined with Hydrawise, you can detect valve solenoid and wiring issues and know that your system runs properly.<br /><br />
                        Adding a professional contractor takes the guesswork out of managing your irrigation system. With Hydrawise, both you and your contractor instantly receive flow and electrical system monitoring alerts. That way, you're notified immediately in the event of a problem, and you can rest assured that your outdoor living space remains protected.
